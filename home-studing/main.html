    <h3>Nothing Else Matters</h3>
    <p class="frase">So close, no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters
        Never opened myself this way
        Life is ours, we live it our way
        All these words I don't just say
        And nothing else matters
        Trust I seek and I find in you
        Every day for us something new
        Open mind for a different view
        And nothing else matters
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know
        So close, no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know
        I never opened myself this way
        Life is ours, we live it our way
        All these words I don't just say
        Nothing else matters
        Trust I seek and I find in you
        Every dayâ€¦
